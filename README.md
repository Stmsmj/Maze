### Modes
the goal is simple , we should start from `green block` to reach the `red block`

There is 3 different modes

#### Play
in this mode you control the game

you should start from green block and reach the red block

> [!IMPORTANT]
> to move you should use ```w , s , a , d``` keys
> 
> ```w : up``` 
> ```s : down``` 
> ```d : right``` 
> ```a : left```

#### BFS
this mode uses the BFS algorithm to find the path between start to end
